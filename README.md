#1. Introduction

	This project has been created for the course "Mobile App Development" at the FH Joanneum.
	It is used as an introduction to Android app developement and represents a simple app on which
	a user can store point of interests (POIs). These POIs can be detected automatically by the GPS
	sensor or entered manually. Entered POIs will be saved in a SQLLite database.
